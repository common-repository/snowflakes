The simplest, lightest, most calming, holiday inspiring falling snow WordPress Plugin ever created.

== Description ==

Want to get into the holiday spirit? Perhaps you fondly remember the nostalgic feelings of winters past, relaxing in front of an open fire, with the soft flutter of snow falling calmly out the window? Maybe you just love winter!


Well, we have the perfect plugin for you.


Snowflakes is the most lightweight but rewarding falling snow plugin ever created. Scientifically tested to ensure that the rate of snowfall is calming (meteorologically described as ‘light flurries’) as opposed to the slightly less calming rates of snowfall found in other falling snow generating plugins (meteorologically described as ‘blizzard’ to ‘white out’). 


Snowflakes takes you back to the coziest memories and moments of winter and is fully responsive with mobile and tablet devices.


Our mindset in developing Snowflakes was to keep it simple, and ensure that the plugin was effective in its purpose.


We hope you enjoy it!
